This interactive dashboard allows you to explore the legacy of residential segregation, one that has led to stark environmental injustice that tremendously ails Black, Latino, and Native American families in Minneapolis.

In this dashboard and following analysis, we chose to investigate the following variables in order to investigate our research questions:

-   Racial Covenants: property warranty deeds in Minneapolis
-   HOLC Grades: Home Owner Loan Corporation (HOLC) neighborhood grades per census tract
-   Social Vulnerability Index: Demographic and socioeconomic factors (such as poverty, lack of access to transportation, and crowded housing) that adversely affect communities that encounter hazards and other community-level stressors.
-   Mean Land Surface Temperature: Average 09/01/2022 Land Surface Temperature per census tract (in Fahrenheit)
-   PM2.5 Emissions: Annual emissions from all air permitted facilities located per zip code (2016-2020)
-   Tree Canopy: Percentage of pixels in a city or neighborhood that are categorized as "tree" (2020)

## Finding

The correlation between climate change effects and marginalized neighborhoods are apparent: **the more socially vulnerable a neighborhood is, the more exposed they are to the effects of climate change---and we can trace this back to residential segregation practices from the early 20th century.**

## Social Vulnerability vs. Climate Change

From our findings, it was clear that socially vulnerable neighborhoods (high poverty levels and minority population) are more exposed to air pollution and higher temperatures.

Before controlling for variables, socially vulnerable census tracts have a higher median for both average PM2.5 emissions and land surface temperature (graph below).

More importantly, **after matching and modelling**, we observed that census tracts with higher social vulnerability are exposed to **0.96 tons** of PM2.5 more than less vulnerable areas. In the same vein, our model revealed that census tracts with higher social vulnerability had a mean land surface temperature that were **2.22Â°F higher** than less vulnerable areas.

## A Closer Look

Let's take a closer look at how residential segregation correlates with the disparity in social vulnerability index*, temperature, and air pollution in different Minneapolis neighborhoods.

**The current CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index uses 16 U.S. Census variables from the 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) to identify communities that may need support before, during, or after disasters. These variables are grouped into four themes that cover four major areas of social vulnerability and then combined into a single measure of overall social vulnerability.*

[@cr-map-svi] First, we will look at the uneven distribution of **social vulnerability score** in Minneapolis as a result of racial covenants and redlining. 


@cr-map-svi-1  Neighborhood who are **less socially vulnerable** tend to reside in **better HOLC** grade neighborhoods with **dense** concentrations of racial covenants.![](assets/images/holc_grade_legend.png){width="100"}![](assets/images/svi_legend.png){width="120"}

@cr-map-svi-2 Yet, social vulnerability score is **much higher** in areas that were viewed as **"undesirable"**--where there were little to no racial covenants.![](assets/images/holc_grade_legend.png){width="100"}![](assets/images/svi_legend.png){width="120"}

[@cr-map-lst] Now, we will see how **land surface temperature** differ in different Minneapolis neighborhoods as a result of racial covenants and redlining.

@cr-map-lst-1 In **better HOLC** grade neighborhoods with **dense** concentrations of racial covenants, today's land surface temperature is **markedly lower**.![](assets/images/holc_grade_legend.png){width="93"}![](assets/images/mean_lst_legend.png){width="120"}

@cr-map-lst-2 Contrastly, land surface temperature is **remarkably higher** in areas that were deemed as **"declining", "hazardous", and "undesirable"**--areas where there were little to no racial covenants.![](assets/images/holc_grade_legend.png){width="110"}![](assets/images/mean_lst_legend.png){width="120"}

[@cr-map-air] Similarly, we can observe these patterns when comparing **levels of air pollution from factories**.

@cr-map-air-1 Neighborhoods with a lot of previous racial covenants, ones that were deemed as **desirable** and **worthy of investment**, tend to have **no** factories planted within its vicinity. They tend to be exposed to **zero** emissions of PM2.5 from nearby factories.![](assets/images/holc_grade_legend.png){width="110"}![](assets/images/air_pollution_legend.png){width="140"}

@cr-map-air-2 On the other hand, in the Near North neighborhood (no racial covenants and C-D HOLC grade), one of Minneapolis' communities with the **biggest BIPOC population**, are exposed to **severely high** levels of PM2.5 emissions. This is because within their area, there are around 15 air emitting factories--including the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center.![](assets/images/holc_grade_legend.png){width="110"}![](assets/images/air_pollution_legend.png){width="140"}
