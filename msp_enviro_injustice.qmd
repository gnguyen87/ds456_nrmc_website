This interactive dashboard allows you to explore the legacy of residential segregation, one that has led to stark environmental injustice that tremendously ails Black, Latino, and Native American families in Minneapolis.

The correlation between climate change effects and marginalized neighborhoods are **apparent**: *the more socially vulnerable a neighborhood is, the more exposed they are to the effects of climate change---and we can trace this back to residential seggregation practices from the early 20th century.*

# Social Vulnerability vs. Climate Change

From our findings, it was clear that socially vulnerable neighborhoods (high poverty levels and minority population) are more exposed to air pollution and higher temperatures.

We observed that census tracts with higher social vulnerability are exposed to **0.96 tons** of PM2.5 more than less vulnerable areas, even when controlling for tree canopy, HOLC grade and racial covenants. In the same vein, our model revealed that census tracts with higher social vulnerability had a mean land surface temperature that were **2.22°F higher** than less vulnerable areas, even when controlling for tree canopy, HOLC grade and racial covenants.

# A Closer Look

Let's take a closer look at how residential seggregation correlates with the disparity in air pollution, and temperature in different Minneapolis neighborhoods.

::: {.cr-section layout="sidebar-left"}
[@cr-map-lst] First, we will look at the uneven distribution of **land surface temperature** in Minneapolis as a result of racial covenants and redlining.

[@cr-map-lst]{pan-to="250px, -300px" scale-by="1.6"} In **higher HOLC** grade neighborhoods with **dense** concentrations of racial covenants, today's land surface temperature is **markedly lower**.

[@cr-map-lst]{pan-to="50px, 300px" scale-by="1.6"} Contrastly, land surface temperature is **remarkably higher** in areas that were deemed as **"declining", "hazardous", and "undesirable"**--areas where there were little to no racial covenants.

[@cr-map-air] Similarly, we can observe these patterns when comparing **levels of air pollution from factories**.

[@cr-map-air]{pan-to="250px, -200px" scale-by="1.7"} Neighborhoods with a lot of previous racial covenants, ones that were deemed as **desirable** and **worthy of investment**, tend to have **no** factories planted within its vacinity. In other words, they tend to be exposed to **zero** emissions of PM2.5 from nearyby factories.

[@cr-map-air]{pan-to="300px, 300px" scale-by="1.6"}  On the other hand, in the Near North neighborhood (no racial covenants and C-D HOLC grade), one of Minneapolis' communities with the **biggest BIPOC population**, are exposed to **severely high** levels of PM2.5 emissions. This is because within their area, there are around 15 air emitting factories--including the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center.

<!-- As you can see, environmental injustices are deeply tied to historical segregation practices. To further study these patterns, we analyzed key numerical results: -->

<!-- ::: {#cr-lst-boxplot} -->

<!-- ![](assets/images/lst_boxplot.png) -->

<!-- ::: -->

<!-- @cr-lst-boxplot - **Land Surface Temperature (LST)**: -->

<!-- -   On average, census tracts with higher social vulnerability had mean land surface temperatures that were **2.22°F higher** than less vulnerable areas, even when controlling for tree canopy coverage. -->

<!-- -   The median of mean land surface temperature for socially vulnerable group is **95.78**, and The median of mean land surface temperature for socially not vulnerable group is **93.78**. -->

<!--     -   On average, census tracts with higher social vulnerability had annual air pollution **0.97 tons** than less vulnerable areas, even when controlling for tree canopy coverage. -->

<!--     -   The median of annual air pollution for socially vulnerable group is **1.597467 tons**, and The median of mean land surface temperature for socially not vulnerable group is **1.013138 tons**. -->

<!-- #### Key Observations: -->

<!-- - Areas with **high mean land surface temperatures** are strongly correlated with **low tree canopy coverage** and **high air pollution levels**. -->

<!-- - These regions overlap with areas having **lower HOLC grades** and **little to no racial covenants**, highlighting systemic disparities. -->

<!-- ::: -->

<!-- ## Regression Insights -->

<!-- To understand these patterns quantitatively, we used regression analysis to explore the relationship between social vulnerability, tree canopy coverage, and mean land surface temperatures. -->

<!-- ### Findings: -->

<!-- - Socially vulnerable neighborhoods experience a **2.22°F increase** in mean land surface temperature compared to less vulnerable areas, holding tree canopy constant. -->

<!-- - Tree canopy significantly mitigates land surface temperatures, with higher coverage reducing the impact of social vulnerability. -->

<!-- ::: {.callout-note} -->

<!-- This underscores how historical practices of residential segregation continue to shape environmental conditions, exacerbating disparities in vulnerable communities. -->
