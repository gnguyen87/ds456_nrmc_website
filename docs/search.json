    "section": "A Closer Look",
    "text": "A Closer Look\nLet’s take a closer look at how residential segregation correlates with the disparity in social vulnerability index*, temperature, and air pollution in different Minneapolis neighborhoods.\n**The current CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index uses 16 U.S. Census variables from the 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) to identify communities that may need support before, during, or after disasters. These variables are grouped into four themes that cover four major areas of social vulnerability and then combined into a single measure of overall social vulnerability.*\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will look at the uneven distribution of social vulnerability score in Minneapolis as a result of racial covenants and redlining.\n\n\n\n\nNeighborhood who are less socially vulnerable tend to reside in higher HOLC grade neighborhoods with dense concentrations of racial covenants.\n\n\n\n\nYet, social vulnerability score is much higher in areas that were viewed as “undesirable”–where there were little to no racial covenants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we will see how land surface temperature differ in different Minneapolis neighborhoods as a result of racial covenants and redlining.\n\n\n\n\nIn higher HOLC grade neighborhoods with dense concentrations of racial covenants, today’s land surface temperature is markedly lower.\n\n\n\n\nContrastly, land surface temperature is remarkably higher in areas that were deemed as “declining”, “hazardous”, and “undesirable”–areas where there were little to no racial covenants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, we can observe these patterns when comparing levels of air pollution from factories.\n\n\n\n\nNeighborhoods with a lot of previous racial covenants, ones that were deemed as desirable and worthy of investment, tend to have no factories planted within its vicinity. They tend to be exposed to zero emissions of PM2.5 from nearby factories.\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, in the Near North neighborhood (no racial covenants and C-D HOLC grade), one of Minneapolis’ communities with the biggest BIPOC population, are exposed to severely high levels of PM2.5 emissions. This is because within their area, there are around 15 air emitting factories–including the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center."

    "text": "Urban areas in the United States are growing to now accommodate about 83% of the population. As cities grow to account for the needs of their populations, it becomes increasingly essential to consider how cities are prioritizing green spaces and urban trees.

The following map and statistical analysis show that there is a need to make urban green space more accessible for disadvantaged communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated above, access to park areas varies across Minneapolis census tracts, with some tracts lacking parks entirely and others having an abundance.

The results from this model show that there is no significant difference in total park area between census tracts of HOLC grades A and B since the P-value is insignificant. However, the model shows a significant decline in total park area in both census tracts of HOLC grades C and D in comparison to HOLC grade A census tracts.

    "section": "",
    "text": "To gain a deeper understanding of the parks and neighborhoods included in our analysis, we conducted site visits to several key locations. Experiencing these areas firsthand allowed us to observe the unique atmosphere and characteristics of each neighborhood. Specifically, we visited Saint Anthony Park, Logan Park, Kenwood Park, Lake of the Isles Park, and the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center (HERC).\n\n\n\n\nThese locations were chosen strategically: Saint Anthony and Logan Parks are situated in neighborhoods with HOLC grades C and D, while Kenwood and Lake of the Isles Park are surrounded by areas with HOLC grades A and B. During these visits, we noted distinct differences in the parks’ features and surrounding environments, providing valuable context for our study.\n\n\n\n\nLake of the Isles Park located in the Calhoun Isles neighborhood of Minneapolis featured bike and walking paths around the lake, docks for fishing, a canoe launch, and a soccer field. While exploring this park, we noticed quickly that the primary use of this space was for recreational exercise. Whether people were out on a run, walking their dog, or participating in a family bike ride, Lake of the Isles park was full of activity.\n\n\n\n\nKenwood Park, located directly North of Lake of the Isles, is a hub for outdoor recreational activities. While walking through the park, we saw the many up-to-date amenities including tennis courts, a frisbee golf course, a softball field, a playground, and a picnic area. During our time at Kenwood park, we observed many groups of frisbee golfers, families playing tennis, and some picnic dates. The most compelling aspect of this visit was that it seemed like everyone was enjoying the park with company, making it a model example for how citizens use urban green spaces as a center for community gatherings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaint Anthony Park, located in the Saint Anthony East neighborhood of Minneapolis, had a small playground, tennis and basketball courts, a softball field, and an artificial hill. Overall, the amenities at this park were dated and in need of some restoration, however it was promising to see some new trees being planted here. Saint Anthony Park is also funded by the Neighborhood Parks Plan and will continue to be maintained and updated through this program.\n\n\n\n\nLogan Park is located in the Logan Park neighborhood of Minneapolis. While walking through this park, we saw a cheery birthday celebration going on in the covered picnic area. This park also had some multipurpose athletic fields, a playground, a basketball hoop, and a walking path. The Neighborhood Parks Plan maintains this park and is committed to investing in parks and communities to enhance racial and economic equity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe visited these parks on a Sunday afternoon in late October and concluded that the most noticeable differences in the parks were in quality of amenities and attendance. While we were exploring, Saint Anthony Park seemed empty, gloomy, and industrial compared to the liveliness and social interaction occurring in both Lake of the Isles Park and Kenwood Park.\n\n\n\n\nNonetheless, we feel that these green spaces are vital to fostering social connections and enhancing the quality of life for all Minneapolis residents. All of the parks we visited not only served a recreational purpose, but also as a place for community gatherings. From birthday parties, jogging sessions with partners, and local sports team events, all kinds of community building activities were hosted at these parks. It was clear to us that access to well-maintained parks contributes to both physical and mental well-being across Minneapolis."
