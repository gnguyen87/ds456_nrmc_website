    "text": "This interactive dashboard allows you to explore the legacy of residential segregation, one that has led to stark environmental injustice that tremendously ails Black, Latino, and Native American families in Minneapolis.\nThe correlation between climate change effects and marginalized neighborhoods are apparent: the more socially vulnerable a neighborhood is, the more exposed they are to the effects of climate change—and we can trace this back to residential seggregation practices from the early 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Vulnerability vs. Climate Change\nFrom our findings, it was clear that socially vulnerable neighborhoods (high poverty levels and minority population) are more exposed to air pollution and higher temperatures.\nBefore controlling for variables, socially vulnerable census tracts have a higher median for both average PM2.5 emissions and land surface temperature (graph below).\n\n \n\nMore importantly, after matching and modelling, we observed that census tracts with higher social vulnerability are exposed to 0.96 tons of PM2.5 more than less vulnerable areas. In the same vein, our model revealed that census tracts with higher social vulnerability had a mean land surface temperature that were 2.22°F higher than less vulnerable areas.\nClick here for the full statistical report!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Closer Look\nLet’s take a closer look at how residential seggregation correlates with the disparity in air pollution, and temperature in different Minneapolis neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will look at the uneven distribution of land surface temperature in Minneapolis as a result of racial covenants and redlining.\n\n\n\n\nIn higher HOLC grade neighborhoods with dense concentrations of racial covenants, today’s land surface temperature is markedly lower.\n\n\n\n\nContrastly, land surface temperature is remarkably higher in areas that were deemed as “declining”, “hazardous”, and “undesirable”–areas where there were little to no racial covenants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, we can observe these patterns when comparing levels of air pollution from factories.\n\n\n\n\nNeighborhoods with a lot of previous racial covenants, ones that were deemed as desirable and worthy of investment, tend to have no factories planted within its vicinity. They tend to be exposed to zero emissions of PM2.5 from nearby factories.\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, in the Near North neighborhood (no racial covenants and C-D HOLC grade), one of Minneapolis’ communities with the biggest BIPOC population, are exposed to severely high levels of PM2.5 emissions. This is because within their area, there are around 15 air emitting factories–including the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center."

    "text": "Urban areas in the United States are growing to now accommodate about 83% of the population (1). As cities grow to accommodate the needs of their populations, it becomes increasingly essential to consider how cities are prioritizing green spaces and urban trees. Along with the ecological benefits, urban green spaces have been shown to improve mental health, physical health, and generate a sense of community for the surrounding residents (2). The following map and statistical analysis show that there is a need to make urban green space more accessible for disadvantaged communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated above, access to park areas varies across Minneapolis census tracts, with some tracts lacking parks entirely and others having an abundance. In order to test whether or not parks are equally available across census tracts in Minneapolis, we performed a linear regression analyzing the relationship between total park area (\\(m^2\\)) and HOLC grade. This data came from [cite HOLC].\nlm(formula = total_park_area ~ holc_grade)\n\n\n\nVariable\nEstimate\nStd. Error\nt-value\nP-value\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n960894\n207396\n4.633\n9.79e-06 ***\n\n\nholc_grade_B\n-189583\n236679\n-0.801\n0.42482\n\n\nholc_grade_C\n-817086\n242877\n-3.364\n0.00105 **\n\n\nholc_grade_D\n-736108\n255695\n-2.879\n0.00478 **\n\n\n\n\n\nThe linear regression model uses the park areas in census tracts of HOLC grade A as a baseline to compare to census tracts of HOLC grades B, C, and D. The results from this model show that there is no significant difference in total park area between census tracts of HOLC grades A and B since the P-value is insignificant. However, the model shows a significant decline in total park area in both census tracts of HOLC grades C and D in comparison to HOLC grade A census tracts. HOLC grade C census tracts are expected to have 817086 \\(m^2\\) less park area than HOLC grade A census tracts, and HOLC grade D census tracts are expected to have 736108 \\(m^2\\) less park area than HOLC grade A census tracts. While this model analyzes the park area across census tracts, our site visit exploration also showed that the parks in HOLC grade A neighborhoods were much more developed and attended than the parks in HOLC grade C and D neighborhoods. This prompts future investment into already existing parks in HOLC grade C and D neighborhoods.\n\n\nAdd introductory sentence Below, we use a linear model to analyze the relationship between park space and social vulnerability in Minneapolis census tracts.\nlm(formula = SVI ~ park_percentage)\n\n\n\nVariable\nEstimate\nStd. Error\nt-value\nP-value\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n0.674195\n0.046930\n14.366\n&lt;210^-16 **\n\n\npark_percentage\n-0.009326\n0.003583\n-2.603\n0.0107\n\n\n\n\n\nThis model shows us that for every additional 1% of a census tract area covered by parks, its social vulnerability score (measured on a 0 to 1 percentile scale) drops by an average of 0.009. That is, if one tract has 10% more green space than another, we can expect it to score 9 percentile points better on SVI, indicating a strong relationship between a community’s access to public green spaces and its overall wellbeing."

How can we, then, inform environmental practices with data?"

    "text": "To gain a deeper understanding of the parks and neighborhoods included in our analysis, we conducted site visits to several key locations. Experiencing these areas firsthand allowed us to observe the unique atmosphere and characteristics of each neighborhood. Specifically, we visited Saint Anthony Park, Logan Park, Kenwood Park, Lake of the Isles Park, and the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center (HERC). These locations were chosen strategically: Saint Anthony and Logan Parks are situated in neighborhoods with HOLC grades C and D, while Kenwood and Lake of the Isles Park are surrounded by areas with HOLC grades A and B. During these visits, we noted distinct differences in the parks’ features and surrounding environments, providing valuable context for our study.\nLake of the Isles park featured bike and walking paths around the lake, docks for fishing, a canoe launch, and a soccer field. The city of Minneapolis completed a large restoration project on the park in 2001 to “create a sustainable as well as usable park space” by restoring the wetlands, improving the lake’s water quality, and reconstructing the recreational paths. To read more about Lake of the isles park, visit https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks-destinations/parks-lakes/lake_of_the_isles_park/.\nAdd pics of Lake of the Isles here\nKenwood Park, located directly North of Lake of the Isles, is a hub for outdoor recreational activities. While walking through the park, we saw the many up-to-date amenities including tennis courts, a frisbee golf course, a softball field, a playground, and a picnic area. This park is well funded by the Neighborhood Parks Plan, well maintained, and well attended, making it a model example for urban green space design. To read more about Kenwood Park, visit https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks-destinations/parks-lakes/kenwood_park/\nAdd pics of Kenwood Park here\nSaint Anthony Park, located in the Saint Anthony East neighborhood of Minneapolis, had a small playground, tennis and basketball courts, a softball field, and an artificial hill. Overall, the amenities at this park were dated and in need of some restoration, however it was promising to see some new trees being planted here. Saint Anthony Park is also funded by the Neighborhood Parks Plan and will continue to be maintained and updated through this program. To read more about Saint Anthony park, visit https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks-destinations/parks-lakes/st_anthony_park/\nAdd pics of Saint Anthony Park here\nLogan Park is located in the Logan Park neighborhood of Minneapolis. While walking through this park, we saw a cheery birthday celebration going on in the covered picnic area. This park also had some multipurpose athletic fields, a playground, a basketball hoop, and a walking path. The Neighborhood Parks Plan maintains this park and is committed to investing in parks and communities to enhance racial and economic equity. To read more about Logan Park, visit https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks-destinations/parks-lakes/logan_park/\nAdd pics of Logan Park\nWe visited these parks on a Sunday afternoon in late October and concluded that the most noticeable differences in the parks were in quality of amenities and attendance. While we were exploring, Saint Anthony Park seemed empty, gloomy, and industrial compared to the liveliness and social interaction occurring in both Lake of the Isles Park and Kenwood Park.\nNonetheless, we feel that these green spaces are vital to fostering social connections and enhancing the quality of life for all Minneapolis residents. All of the parks we visited not only served a recreational purpose, but also as a place for community gatherings. From birthday parties, jogging sessions with partners, and local sports team events, all kinds of community building activities were hosted at these parks. It was clear to us that access to well-maintained parks contributes to both physical and mental well-being across Minneapolis."
