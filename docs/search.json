And there has been extensive research around environmental injustice, yet they tend to merely provide a snapshot of this picture at a moment in time.

In other words, how much does the introduction of racial covenants in the 1910s impact the environmental inequality in Minneapolis that we see today? How can we, then, inform environmental practices with data?"
