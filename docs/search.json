    "text": "This interactive dashboard allows you to explore the legacy of residential segregation, one that has led to stark environmental injustice that tremendously ails Black, Latino, and Native American families in Minneapolis.\nThe correlation between climate change effects and marginalized neighborhoods are apparent: the more socially vulnerable a neighborhood is, the more exposed they are to the effects of climate change—and we can trace this back to residential seggregation practices from the early 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Vulnerability vs. Climate Change\nFrom our findings, it was clear that socially vulnerable neighborhoods (high poverty levels and minority population) are more exposed to air pollution and higher temperatures.\nWe observed that census tracts with higher social vulnerability are exposed to 0.96 tons of PM2.5 more than less vulnerable areas, even when controlling for tree canopy, HOLC grade and racial covenants. In the same vein, our model revealed that census tracts with higher social vulnerability had a mean land surface temperature that were 2.22°F higher than less vulnerable areas, even when controlling for tree canopy, HOLC grade and racial covenants.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Closer Look\nLet’s take a closer look at how residential seggregation correlates with the disparity in air pollution, and temperature in different Minneapolis neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will look at the uneven distribution of land surface temperature in Minneapolis as a result of racial covenants and redlining.\n\n\n\n\nIn higher HOLC grade neighborhoods with dense concentrations of racial covenants, today’s land surface temperature is markedly lower.\n\n\n\n\nContrastly, land surface temperature is remarkably higher in areas that were deemed as “declining”, “hazardous”, and “undesirable”–areas where there were little to no racial covenants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, we can observe these patterns when comparing levels of air pollution from factories.\n\n\n\n\nNeighborhoods with a lot of previous racial covenants, ones that were deemed as desirable and worthy of investment, tend to have no factories planted within its vicinity. They tend to be exposed to zero emissions of PM2.5 from nearby factories.\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, in the Near North neighborhood (no racial covenants and C-D HOLC grade), one of Minneapolis’ communities with the biggest BIPOC population, are exposed to severely high levels of PM2.5 emissions. This is because within their area, there are around 15 air emitting factories–including the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center."

    "text": "Urban areas in the United States are growing to now accommodate about 83% of the population (1). As cities grow to accommodate the needs of their populations, it becomes increasingly essential to consider how cities are prioritizing green spaces and urban trees. Along with the ecological benefits, urban green spaces have been shown to improve mental health, physical health, and generate a sense of community for the surrounding residents (2). The following map and statistical analysis show that there is a need to make urban green space more accessible for disadvantaged communities.\n\n\n\nWarning: package 'jsonlite' was built under R version 4.4.1\n\n\nWarning: package 'sf' was built under R version 4.4.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated above, access to park areas varies across Minneapolis census tracts, with some tracts lacking parks entirely and others having an abundance. In order to test whether or not parks are equally available across census tracts in Minneapolis, we performed a linear regression analyzing the relationship between total park area (\\(m^2\\)) and HOLC grade. This data came from [cite HOLC].\nlm(formula = total_park_area ~ holc_grade)\n\n\n\nVariable\nEstimate\nStd. Error\nt-value\nP-value\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n960894\n207396\n4.633\n9.79e-06 ***\n\n\nholc_grade_B\n-189583\n236679\n-0.801\n0.42482\n\n\nholc_grade_C\n-817086\n242877\n-3.364\n0.00105 **\n\n\nholc_grade_D\n-736108\n255695\n-2.879\n0.00478 **\n\n\n\n\n\nThe linear regression model uses the park areas in census tracts of HOLC grade A as a baseline to compare to census tracts of HOLC grades B, C, and D. The results from this model show that there is no significant difference in total park area between census tracts of HOLC grades A and B since the P-value is insignificant. However, the model shows a significant decline in total park area in both census tracts of HOLC grades C and D in comparison to HOLC grade A census tracts. HOLC grade C census tracts are expected to have 817086 \\(m^2\\) less park area than HOLC grade A census tracts, and HOLC grade D census tracts are expected to have 736108 \\(m^2\\) less park area than HOLC grade A census tracts. While this model analyzes the park area across census tracts, our site visit exploration also showed that the parks in HOLC grade A neighborhoods were much more developed and attended than the parks in HOLC grade C and D neighborhoods. This prompts future investment into already existing parks in HOLC grade C and D neighborhoods.\n\n\nAdd introductory sentence Below, we use a linear model to analyze the relationship between park space and social vulnerability in Minneapolis census tracts.\nlm(formula = SVI ~ total_park_area)\n\n\n\nVariable\nEstimate\nStd.

That is, if one tract has 10% more green space than another, we can expect it to score 9 percentile points better on SVI, indicating a strong relationship between a community’s access to public green spaces and its overall wellbeing."

How can we, then, inform environmental practices with data?"
